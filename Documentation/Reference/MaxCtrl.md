# MaxCtrl

MaxCtrl is a command line administrative client for MaxScale which uses
the MaxScale REST API for communication. It is intended to be the
replacement software for the legacy MaxAdmin command line client.

By default, the MaxScale REST API listens on port 8989 on the local host. The
default credentials for the REST API are `admin:mariadb`. The users used by the
REST API are the same that are used by the MaxAdmin network interface. This
means that any users created for the MaxAdmin network interface should work with
the MaxScale REST API and MaxCtrl.

For more information about the MaxScale REST API, refer to the
[REST API documentation](../REST-API/API.md) and the
[Configuration Guide](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md).

The new listener will be taken into use immediately.

### create user

Usage: `maxctrl.js create user <name> <password>`

The created user can be used with the MaxScale REST API as well as the MaxAdmin
network interface. By default the created user will have administrative
privileges. To limit the user to read-only operations, use the `--type=basic`
option.

## destroy

```
Usage: destroy <command>

Commands:
  server <name>              Destroy an unused server
  monitor <name>             Destroy an unused monitor
  listener <service> <name>  Destroy an unused listener
  user <name>                Remove a network user

```

### destroy server

Usage: `maxctrl.js destroy server <name>`

The server must be unlinked from all services and monitor before it can be
destroyed.

### destroy monitor

Usage: `maxctrl.js destroy monitor <name>`

The monitor must be unlinked from all servers before it can be destroyed.

### destroy listener

Usage: `maxctrl.js destroy listener <service> <name>`

Destroying a monitor causes it to be removed on the next restart. Destroying a
listener at runtime stops it from accepting new connections but it will still be
bound to the listening socket. This means that new listeners cannot be created
to replace destroyed listeners without restarting MaxScale.

### destroy user

Usage: `maxctrl.js destroy user <name>`

The last remaining administrative user cannot be removed. Create a replacement
administrative user before attempting to remove the last administrative user.

## link

```
Usage: link <command>

Commands:
  service <name> <server...>  Link servers to a service
  monitor <name> <server...>  Link servers to a monitor

```

### link service

Usage: `maxctrl.js link service <name> <server...>`

This command links servers to a service, making them available for any
connections that use the service. Before a server is linked to a service, it
should be linked to a monitor so that the server state is up to date. Newly
linked server are only available to new connections, existing connections will
use the old list of servers.

### link monitor

Usage: `maxctrl.js link monitor <name> <server...>`

Linking a server to a monitor will add it to the list of servers that are
monitored by that monitor. A server can be monitored by only one monitor at a
time.

## unlink

```
Usage: unlink <command>

Commands:
  service <name> <server...>  Unlink servers from a service
  monitor <name> <server...>  Unlink servers from a monitor

```

### unlink service

Usage: `maxctrl.js unlink service <name> <server...>`

This command unlinks servers from a service, removing them from the list of
available servers for that service. New connections to the service will not use
the unlinked servers but existing connections can still use the servers.

### unlink monitor

Usage: `maxctrl.js unlink monitor <name> <server...>`

This command unlinks servers from a monitor, removing them from the list of
monitored servers. The servers will be left in their current state when they are
unlinked from a monitor.

## start

```
Usage: start <command>

Commands:
  service <name>  Start a service
  monitor <name>  Start a monitor
  maxscale        Start MaxScale by starting all services

```

### start service

Usage: `maxctrl.js start service <name>`

This starts a service stopped by `stop service <name>`

### start monitor

Usage: `maxctrl.js start monitor <name>`

This starts a monitor stopped by `stop monitor <name>`

### start maxscale

Usage: `maxctrl.js start maxscale`

This command will execute the `start service` command for all services in
MaxScale.

## stop

```
Usage: stop <command>

Commands:
  service <name>  Stop a service
  monitor <name>  Stop a monitor
  maxscale        Stop MaxScale by stopping all services

```

### stop service

Usage: `maxctrl.js stop service <name>`

Stopping a service will prevent all the listeners for that service from
accepting new connections. Existing connections will still be handled normally
until they are closed.

### stop monitor

Usage: `maxctrl.js stop monitor <name>`

Stopping a monitor will pause the monitoring of the servers. This can be used to
manually control server states with the `set server` command.

### stop maxscale

Usage: `maxctrl.js stop maxscale`

This command will execute the `stop service` command for all services in
MaxScale.

## alter

```
Usage: alter <command>

Commands:
  server <server> <key> <value>    Alter server parameters
  monitor <monitor> <key> <value>  Alter monitor parameters

To display the monitor parameters, execute `show monitor <monitor>`

### alter service

Usage: `maxctrl.js alter service <service> <key> <value>`

of parameters can be altered at runtime:

[
    "auth_connect_timeout",
    "auth_read_timeout",
    "auth_write_timeout",
    "admin_auth"
]

## rotate

```
Usage: rotate <command>

Commands:

  sync <target>  Synchronize the cluster with target MaxScale server.

```

### cluster diff

Usage: `maxctrl.js cluster diff <target>`

The list of host servers is controlled with the --hosts option. The target
server should not be in the host list. Value of <target> must be in HOST:PORT
format

### cluster sync

Usage: `maxctrl.js cluster sync <target>`

This command will alter all MaxScale instances given in the --hosts option to
represent the <target> MaxScale. If the synchronization of a MaxScale instance
fails, it will be disabled by executing the `stop maxscale` command on that
instance. Synchronization can be attempted again if a previous attempt failed
due to a network failure or some other ephemeral error. Any other errors require
manual synchronization of the MaxScale configuration files and a restart of the
failed Maxscale.
