Release 2.3.2 is a XXX release.

This document describes the changes in release 2.3.2, when compared to the
previous release in the same series.

## Changed Features

### Watchdog

The systemd watchdog is now safe to use in all circumstances.

By default it is enabled with a timeout of 60 seconds.

### Readwritesplit

#### `connection_keepalive`

The default value of `connection_keepalive` is now 300 seconds. This prevents
the connections from dying due to wait_timeout with longer sessions. This is
especially helpful with pooled connections that stay alive for a very long time.
