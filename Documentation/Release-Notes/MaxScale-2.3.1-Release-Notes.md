# MariaDB MaxScale 2.3.1 Release Notes

Release 2.3.1 is a Beta release.

This document describes the changes in release 2.3.1, when compared to
release 2.3.0.

For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report at [Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org).

## Changed Features

### Binlog Router

Secondary masters can now be specified also when file + position
based replication is used. Earlier it was possible only in conjunction
with GTID based replication.

### `mmmon` and `ndbclustermon`

Both of these modules have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. The functionality in `mmmon` has been largely obsoleted by the
advancements in `mariadbmon`. The `ndbclustermon` is largely obsolete due to the
fact that there are virtually no users who use it.

### Deprecated options

The following configuration file options have been deprecated and will
be removed in 2.4.

#### Global section
* `non_blocking_polls`
* `poll_sleep`
* `thread_stack_size`

#### Services and Monitors
* `passwd`

### MaxAdmin

The commands `set pollsleep` and `set nbpolls` have been deprecated and
will be removed in 2.4.

## New Features

### MaxCtrl

There is now a new command `classify <statement>` using which it can
be checked if and how MaxScale classifies a specific statement. This
feature can be used for debugging, if there is suspicion that MaxScale
sends a particular statement to the wrong server (e.g. to a slave when it
should be sent to the master).
