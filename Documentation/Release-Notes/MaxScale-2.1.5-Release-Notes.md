## Changed Features

### Schemarouter

Starting with MaxScale 2.1.5, the _schemarouter_ will prioritize the current
database over an explicit database if tables in the the current database are
used in a query.

## New Features

### Schemarouter

A new parameter for the _schemarouter_ was added that allows deterministic
resolution of database mapping conflicts (i.e. the database exists on more than
one backend server).

The new `preferred_server` parameter takes a server name as its value. If a
database mapping conflict occurs, the server given as the parameter will have
preference. In practice, this means that databases on a central server can be
replicated to the shards for doing JOINs but writes to the replicate database
will still go to the central database.
